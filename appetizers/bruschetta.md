Once the tomatoes are in season, I don't think theres any better way to celebrate.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 1 lb ripe soft tomatoes
* [ ] 1 tsp salt
* [ ] 5 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* [ ] 2 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced
* [ ] 8 large basil leaves, ribboned
* [ ] Toasted crostinis

Preparation
===========
1. Coursely chop tomatoes. Add salt and gently stir. Let sit in strainer for an hour for juices to drain. (Optional: Keep that juice, add olive oil and use as the BEST salad dressing you've ever had).
2. Over medium low heat, warm olive oil and garlic. Bring to just before a simmer, when you start to see tiny bubbles. Remove from heat and set aside to return to room temp.
3. Combined tomatoes, garlic oil, and basil in a bowl. Serve on some quality bread.
