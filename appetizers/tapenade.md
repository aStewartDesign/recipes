Working on this, it's pretty good, but could use a little nudge.

Ingredients
===========
* [ ] 2 small garlic cloves, roughly chopped
* [ ] 3 anchovies, roughly chopped
* [ ] 2 tbsp salted capers, rinsed, drained and roughly chopped
* [ ] 1 cup pitted black olives and/or green olives, roughly chopped
* [ ] 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* [ ] fresh ground black pepper

Preparation
===========
1. Mash garlic, anchovies, and capers into a consistent paste.
2. Add paste, olives, oil, and pepper to a food processor. Mix until a gritty paste consistency.

Notes
=====
* So I rinced my olives beforehand to make them a little less salty. Should play with this more.
