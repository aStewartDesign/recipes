Fresh Arab flatbread is one of the finer parts of life. Here's how I make it.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 420 g flour
* [ ] 1/4 cup milk powder
* [ ] 1 tsp salt
* [ ] 1 tsp instant yeast
* [ ] 320 g water (1 1/2 cup)
* [ ] 2 tbps EVOO


Preparation
===========
1. Mix all dry ingredients. Add oil and water warmed to 90-100 degrees. Mix til just combined. Cover and set aside for an hour.
2. Divide into 3 parts, and place in containers. Put one container in the fridge, and the other two in the freezer. Let rest overnight. These can stay in the fridge up to 3 days.
3. Divide out 1/3 of the overnight dough. Roll out into a flat circle about 2mm thick.
4. Heat for about an minute on a dry hot pan until bubbles form. Then place in air fryer at 500 (or preheated dutch oven) for 1.5 minute or until puffed and lightly browned.
5. Place in towel, and repeat for however many pieces of bread you want.

Notes

* To make Manakeesh - once the dough is rolled out, poke with then end of a fork. Add toppings right after placing on the pan.
  * Cheese mixuture is 1 part feta/akawi to 1.5 part fresh mozz
