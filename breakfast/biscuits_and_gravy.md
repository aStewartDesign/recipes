Ingredients
===========

##### Biscuits
* 2 and 1/2 cups (312g) all-purpose flour, (spoon & leveled)*
* 2 Tablespoons baking powder (yes, Tablespoons!)
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, very cold and cubed*
* 1 cup + 2 Tablespoons (270ml) cold buttermilk, divided
* 1 egg

##### Gravy
* 1/4 cup Butter
* 1 pound Country Sausage
* 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 cups whole milk
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper

Preparation
===========

##### Biscuits
1. Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Place the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl or in a large food processor. Whisk or pulse until combined. Add the cubed butter and cut into the dry ingredients with a pastry cutter or by pulsing several times in the processor. Pulse until coarse crumbs form. See photo above for a visual. If you used a food processor, pour the mixture into a large bowl.
2. Make a well in the center of the mixture. Pour 1 cup of buttermilk (240ml) on top, then the honey. Stir everything together until just about combined– do not overwork the dough. The dough will look like shreds and be very crumbly. See photo above for a visual.
3. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and gently mold it into a rough looking rectangle using your hands. Use the photos above as a guide. Fold one side into the center, then the other side. Turn the dough so it’s long horizontally. Gently flatten. Repeat the folding again. Turn the dough so it’s long horizontally once more. Gently flatten. Repeat the folding one more time.
4. Gently roll the dough out with a rolling pin until it’s 1 inch thick. Cut into 3-inch circles. Re-roll any scraps until you have 9-12 biscuits. Arrange in a 10-inch cast iron skillet or close together on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. (Make sure they’re touching.)
5. Brush the tops with remaining buttermilk. Bake for 15 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown on top.
6. Remove from the oven and, if desired, brush with melted butter and honey mixture. Enjoy warm. Cover leftovers tightly and store at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

##### Gravy
1. Heat large skillet over medium heat. Add sausage; cook 10 to 12 minutes until crumbled and browned, stirring occasionally. Remove sausage.
2. Stir flour into 4 tablespoons drippings remaining in skillet and cook about 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
3. Add milk and cook about 5 minutes until thickened and bubbly. Add additional milk if gravy seems too thick. Add sausage to gravy.
4. Season with salt and pepper. Serve immediately over hot biscuits or potatoes.

Notes
=====

Test making biscuits with a little less buttermilk and an egg instead.

Can sub mushrooms for Sausage, but double butter.
