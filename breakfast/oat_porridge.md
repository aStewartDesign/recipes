Allow me to preach unto you the gospel of porridge. Sweet oatmeal has is place, but it's overrated. It's everywhere, it gives me a stomach ache, and I get sick of it super fast.

Porridge on the other hand doesn't get enought credit. It's a really great base to your breakfast. Sure it boring but eat it with eggs, fresh fruit, cucumber, and nuts. It's amazing how good you'll feel, and you don't get sick of it. 

It has enough whole grains, and fiber to keep you full all day. Oh and did I mention it's CHEAP? Get it from the bulk section. $6 worth of food feeds two people for a month. Meal prep this recipe, and it'll save you time.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 300g steel cut oats
* [ ] 1600g cups water
* [ ] 60g tbsp boullion

Preparation
===========
#### Pressure Cooker
1. Mix all ingredients in your rice cooker, pressure cook for 11 minutes and let depressure naturally.
2. Mix well & store in a sealed container. You've got breakfast for two weeks

#### Stovetop
1. Add water and boullion to pot and bring to a boil. Add oats, lower heat, and cover. Stir occasionally for 20-30 minutes or longer until tender.

Notes
=====

* If you really just want sweet oats follow the same instructions but omit the boullion. Sub half the water for milk. Add sugar or other sweet ingredients at the end.
