Allow me to preach unto you the gospel of porridge. Sweet oatmeal has is place, but it's overrated. It's everywhere, it gives me a stomach ache, and I get sick of it super fast.

Porridge on the other hand doesn't get enought credit. It's a really great base to your breakfast. Sure it boring but eat it with eggs, fresh fruit, cucumber, and nuts. It's amazing how good you'll feel, and you don't get sick of it. 

It has enough whole grains, and fiber to keep you full all day. Oh and did I mention it's CHEAP? Get it from the bulk section. $6 worth of food feeds two people for a month. Meal prep this recipe, and it'll save you time.
