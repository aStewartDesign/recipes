These cookies are the first I ever mastered. The base recipe is from some holiday cookbook from my childhood.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 1 1/2 cup   Sugar
* [ ] 1 cup       Olive Oil
* [ ] 2           Eggs
* [ ] 1 tsp       Vanilla Extract
* [ ] 1 tsp       Anise or almond extract
* [ ] 3 1/2 cups  Flour
* [ ] 1 1/2 tsp   Baking Powder
* [ ] 1/2 tsp     Salt
* [ ] 1 1/2 cup   Toasted Almonds

Preparation
===========
1. Cream together sugar and olive oil. Add eggs and extracts.
2. By hand mix in flour, baking soda, and salt. Once thoroughly combined add almonds.
3. Let dough rest for 1 hour.
4. On lined cookie sheet, divide dough in half. Form two rectangles, about 1/2 inch thick.
5. Bake at 350 for 25(?) minutes. Until just cooked in the middle.
6. Take loaves out of oven. Allow them to cool for about 5 minutes. 
7. Then gently and using a serrated knife, saw them on the short side at about 3/4 inch thick.
8. Place each biscotti back on sheet tray with as much spacing at you can while still getting the entire batch on a single sheet tray.
9. Bake again for 12-15 mintues. Until hard and golden brown.
10. Let cool. Serve with coffee, tea, or warm milk.
