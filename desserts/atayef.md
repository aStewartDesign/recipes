Atayef for those who don't know, an arab sweet traditionally made during Ramadan. Think a small pancake folded in half like a calzone, stuffed with sweet cream cheeses, and drizzled with a floral syrup. They really are quite delicious.

Ingredients
===========

##### Batter
* [ ] 3 cups warm water
* [ ] 2 1/4 cup flour
* [ ] 1/2 cup fine semolina
* [ ] 2 tbsp powdered milk
* [ ] 2 tbsp sugar
* [ ] 1/2 tsp instant yeast
* [ ] 1/2 tsp baking powder
* [ ] 1/4 tsp salt
* [ ] 1/2 tsp baking soda

##### Filling
* [ ] 10 oz akkawi cheese (or 50/50 blend of ricotta and fresh mozzarella)
* [ ] 4 oz fresh mozzarella cheese, grated
* [ ] 5 tbsp sugar
* [ ] 1 tbsp orange blossom water

##### Simple Syrup
* [ ] 1 cup water
* [ ] 1 cup sugar
* [ ] 1 1/2 tsp orange blossom water

Preparation
===========
1. Add all batter ingredients except baking soda in a blender. Blend for 2 minutes. Add baking soda and blend for 15 seconds. Let sit out for 5 minutes (30 minutes if recipe is halved).
2. In a bowl using a fork, mix the filling ingredients well until homogenous.
3. In a small pot, bring water and sugar just to a boil. Remove from heat. Stir in orange blossom water. Allow to cool.
4. Over medium high heat, pour 3 inch pancakes. Cook on one side until top is no longer wet. The cooked side should have a light brown color, and ring on the outside of the pancake. Place in towel lined plate and cook the rest of the pancakes.
5. Place about 1-2 tsp of cheese filling in the uncooked side of the pancake. Fold over and press the edge to seal. Continue with the rest of the pancakes. At this point you can cover and chill them in a fridge for up to a week if necessary.
6. Heat a large pan over medium high heat. Lightly cook atayef for a few minutes on each side to heat all the way through.
7. Drizzle with Orange blossom simple syrup.
8. Serve Warm.
