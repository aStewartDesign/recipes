Simple Banana bread recipe. BUT have you tried grilling it with a little bit of butter in a pan??? One of lifes little gifts.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 250g flour
* [ ] 1 tsp baking soda
* [ ] 1/4 tsp salt
* [ ] 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
* [ ] 1 stick unsalted butter, softened
* [ ] 3/4 cup packed light or dark brown sugar
* [ ] 2 lg eggs
* [ ] 1/3 cup plain yogurt or sour cream
* [ ] 4 lg ripe bananas
* [ ] 1 tsp pure vanilla extract
* [ ] 3/4 cup chopped walnuts, optional

Preparation
===========
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together in a medium bowl.
3. Beat the butter and brown sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then add the yogurt, mashed bananas, and vanilla extract combined. Slowly fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients until no flour pockets remain. Do not over-mix.
4. Pour and spread the batter into the parchment lined baking pan. Bake for 60–65 minutes, making sure to loosely cover the bread with aluminum foil halfway through to prevent the top from getting too brown. The bread is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean with only a few small moist crumbs.
5. Remove from oven, let cool for at least 30 min. Cover and store banana bread at room temperature for 2 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Banana bread tastes best on day 2 after the flavors have settled together.

Notes
=====

This also freezes well.
