Legendary Browned Butter cake from Polo. You cannot beat it.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 149g sugar
* [ ] 1 stick butter
* [ ] 1.5 tsp baking powder
* [ ] 0.5g baking soda
* [ ] 9g vanilla extract or paste
* [ ] 5g water
* [ ] 3g salt
* [ ] 1 egg (room temp)
* [ ] 5oz cake flour
* [ ] 5.5 oz whole milk (room temp)

Preparation
===========
1. Heat butter in sauce pan over medium low heat until brown and nutty. Measure out 69g of brown butter into the bow of a stand mixer making sure to scrape brown bits off the bottom of the pot. Allow to cool to 70 degrees F. An ice bath can expedite this process but make sure it doesn't go below 70.
2. Butter the bottom of two 6in cake pans. Place parchment rounds in each pan. Butter the entire interior of the pans and coat with flour tapping out the excess. Preheat oven to 350F.
3. Cream cooled brown butter and sugar over medium speed in a stand mixer until pale, light, and 1.5x original volume. Scrape down the bowl and add in baking powder, baking soda, vanilla, water, and salt. Beat over medium speed until combined. Beat the room temp egg and slowly stream the beaten egg into the mixing bowl while running. Beat until completely combined.
4. Reduce speed to low. Add in 1/3 of the flour mixing until just combined and slowly stream in half the milk. Repeat this process with a second third of the flour and the rest of the milk. Add the rest of the flour and mix until just combined.
5. Weigh bowl + cake batter and subtract the bowl weight. Divide the number by two. This is how much batter to fill into each cake pan. Fill prepared pans and tap the pans a few times on the counter to flatten. Bake for 30 minutes rotating halfway through or until the cakes temp at 200F internally.
6. Allow to cool in pans for at least ten minutes then unmold from pans allowing to cool on a wire rack until completely cool.

**Note**: the two most important parts of this recipe are ingredient temperatures and the alternating of wet and dry at the end. This batter is a super delicate emulsion and having the temps off or adding the milk to quickly with break it. If the emulsion does break and the batter looks curdled at the end, the taste will still be same but the crumb will be much more dense/the cakes may collapse.
