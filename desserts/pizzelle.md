A traditional Italian dessert. Pizzelles are kind of like a waffle ice cream cone.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 3         large Eggs
* [ ] 3/4 cup   Sugar
* [ ] 1 3/4 cup Flour
* [ ] 2 tsp     Baking Powder
* [ ] 1/2 cup   Butter, melted
* [ ] 1 Tbsp.   Vanilla Extract or/and Anise Extract

Preparation
===========
1. In a medium mixing bowl, cream together eggs and sugar. Once smooth, mix in melted butter and extract.
2. In a second mixing bowl whisk together flour and baking powder.
3. Gently fold the dry mixture into the wet mixture. Let rest for 30 minutes. Dough will be very sticky.
4. Heat Pizzelle Iron. Lightly oil. Place about 1 1/2 tbsp of mixture in the upper center of iron. Press down, and cook according to instructions. Should be about 3 minutes.
5. The first one or two will not come out nicely, but don't give up hope. The iron always comes through.
