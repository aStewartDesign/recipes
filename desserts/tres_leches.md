Few things are better than a good Tres Leches. Quatro Leches might be one of them.

Ingredients
===========

##### Cake
* [ ] 6 eggs separated
* [ ] 3/4 tsp (2g) vanilla extract
* [ ] 1/2 cup (120ml) whole milk
* [ ] 1 cup (220g) granulated sugar
* [ ] 1.5 cup (225g) all-purpose flour
* [ ] 1/2 tsp 3g fine sea salt
* [ ] 1.5 tsp 7g baking powder
* [ ] 14 oz (400ml) sweetened condensed milk or one can
* [ ] 12oz (350ml) evaporated milk or one can
* [ ] 1 vanilla bean *optional*
* [ ] 1/2 cup (120ml) heavy cream

##### Dulche de Leche
* [ ] 4 cups 1-liter milk
* [ ] 1.25 (270g) cups sugar

Preparation
===========
1. In a medium bowl, crack in the eggs then separate the yolks into a large bowl.
2. Beat the egg yolks using an electric beater on high speed. Slowly add in granulated sugar until all the sugar is added. Beat in vanilla extract along with whole milk.
3. Separately with the egg whites, beat on high speed until frothy.
4. Add in granulated sugar in batches while continuing to beat. Beat until stiff peaks.
5. Fold both mixtures together.
6. Separately mix together all-purpose flour, fine sea salt, and baking powder. Once mixed add to other mixture and fold until combined.
7. Prepare a 9x13 baking pan by generously greasing it with nonstick cooking spray.
8. Pour the sponge cake batter into the pan and toss into the oven set at 350F for 25-30 minutes then cool completely.
9. For the evaporated milk, lightly simmer whole milk, stirring occasionally, in a medium saucepan for 25 minutes. Once reduced, strain into a separate container.
10. In a medium size bowl, combine sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, vanilla bean, and heavy cream. Whisk together.
11. Using a fork, poke holes across the cold spong cake and pour on the milk mixture across the whole cake. Cover with plastic wrap and fridge for 1 hour to overnight.
12. For the dulce de leche, combine whole milk with granulated sugar. Simmer over medium heat. Reduce to medium-low once simmering. Heat and stir often for 90 minutes until thickened and cool at room temperature.
13. Remove the spong cake from the fridge, cover evenly across the top with the dulce de leche.
14. *Optional*: Whip heavy cream with granulated sugar until a fluffy whipped cream. Spread across the cake and sprinkle with ground cinnamon. 

Notes
=====

Really good with some banana slices on top.
