Arayes are kind of like an arab hamburger, but better than you're thinking. This is great at a bbq. 

Since it's covered on all sides but one with a carb and you eat it with your hands, I'm calling it a dumpling. Deal.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 1/2 large onion, quarted
* [ ] 2 tomatoes, seeded, quartered
* [ ] 6 cloves garlic
* [ ] 1/2 jalapeno, seeded and chopped
* [ ] 1 1/2 lb ground beef/lamb
* [ ] 2 tsp salt
* [ ] 1/4 tsp pepper
* [ ] 1/4 tsp 7 spice
* [ ] 1/4 tsp aleppo pepper
* [ ] 1 1/2 tbsp pomegranate molasses
* [ ] 1 cup parsley, finely chopped
* [ ] 6 rounds of [arab bread](../breads/arab_pita_bread.md), cut in half
* [ ] EVOO for brushing

Preparation
===========
1. In a food processor, chop onion. Squeeze out the juice and add pulp back to food processor.
2. Add tomatoes, garlic, jalapeno. Process into a paste.
3. Add meat and veggie paste to a bowl. Add salt, pepper, 7 spice, and alepo pepper. Mix by hand until evenly incorperated. If you're not about to cook them cover at this point and keep in the fridge. 
4. Add pomegranate molasses and parsley. Mix evenly.
5. Scoop 1/4-1/3 cup of meat into the pita pocket. Smash down gently to fill in the full pita pocke to the edges. Meat should be 5-8mm thick.
6. Brush outside of pitas with evoo.
7. Bake in oven (425F), or preferrably over grill untl cripy on the outside and fully cooked in the center.

Serve hot with [fattoush](../salads/fattoush.md), [tabbouleh](../salads/tabbouleh.md), or another salad. 

Great with [jalapeno lemon sacue](../sauces/jalapeno_lemon_sauce.md) and [mint yogurt sauce](../sauces/mint_yogurt_sauce.md) or [white sauce](../sauces/halal_cart_white_sauce.md).

Notes
=====

* Meat was a little soft for Tarik's preference. I've removed moisture in the instructions. If it's still too wet try adding an egg and/or bread crumbs.
