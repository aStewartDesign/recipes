Lemon and Garlic Flavored Stuffed Cabbage?! What more does the heart want?

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 2 Large heads of Cabbage
* [ ] 3 cups short or med grain Rice
* [ ] 1 1/2 tsp Tumeric
* [ ] 1 1/2 tsp Cumin
* [ ] 1 1/2 tsp Pepper
* [ ] 1 tsp Aleppo Pepper
* [ ] 5 tsp 7 Spice
* [ ] 3 tsp Salt
* [ ] 1/2 Onion, Minced
* [ ] 20 Cloves Garlic
* [ ] 1 lb Ground Beef
* [ ] 4 Lemons
* [ ] 1 Tbsp. Dried Mint
* [ ] 4 cups Chicken Broth, bullion in fine
* [ ] 1/2 cup EVOO

Preparation
===========

##### The Cabbage
1. Rinse and soak the rice for 30 minute in warm water. Nothing to do with cabbage—I know.
2. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
3. Peel off the top few dirty leaves.
4. Using a knife cut out the core down about three or four inches.
5. Once the water is boiling, cook the cabbage—core down—for two or three minutes.
6. Flip the head over, pull off the leaves and cook for an additional minute or two until soft and will lay flat. Don't bother keeping leave smaller than 5 inches in diameter.
7. Drain and stack the leaves. Then repeat on the second head.
8. Cut the thick, stiff part off each leaf.
9. For very large leaves, cut the leaves in to quarters. For medium leaves, cut in half. For small leaves leave whole.

##### The Filling
1. By now the rice should be done soaking. Drain the rice. Add tumeric, cumin, pepper, aleppo pepper, 7 spice, and salt.
2. Add minced onion, 8 cloves of garlic (minced), and beef. Mix together well.
3. Slice up remaining garlic and put in separate bowl.

##### Form the Rolls
1. Place unused thick cuttings to form a layer on the bottom of large pot. This will keep the rolls from burning when cooked.
2. One at a time, place a few tsp of the filling onto a leaf in a thin line. Place in such a way that you will be able to roll it a few times around. Just a single layer or two of cabbage will easily break.
3. Place rolls into pot in a tight layer. Once a layer is complete, sprinkle some dried mint and a slices of garlic around.

##### Cooking
1. In a bowl mix together boiling broth, the juice of two lemons, and the olive oil. Pour over rolls until just covering the top of the pile.
2. Place a plate on top of the rolls to weigh them down. Cover pot.
3. Cook on medium high heat for 25 minutes. Then on medium low heat for another 30 minutes, until all or almost all the liquid is absorbed.
4. Flip pot over onto serving plate, let cool for a few minutes and enjoy.

###### Sauce
1. Using a blender, cream together more garlic and lemon juice. Serve over Malfoof.
