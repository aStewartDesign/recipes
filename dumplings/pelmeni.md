Ingredients
===========

##### Dough
* [ ] 1 Egg (Beaten)
* [ ] 1/2 cup Cold Water
* [ ] 1/2 cup Milk
* [ ] 1/2 tsp Kosher Salt
* [ ] 3 cup Flour

##### Filling
* [ ] 1/2 large Onion (minced)
* [ ] 1/2 lb ground Pork
* [ ] 1/2 lb ground Beef
* [ ] 1 tsp Kosher Salt
* [ ] 1 Tbsp Olive Oil
* [ ] 3 cloves Garlic (crushed)

##### Cooking
* [ ] 1 1/2 handfuls of dumplings per person.
* [ ] 1 dollop Sour Cream
* [ ] 1 capful of Vinegar
* [ ] Sriracha (to taste)
* [ ] Curry Powder
* [ ] Cilantro (chopped)

Preparation
===========
##### Dough
1. Mix wet ingredients, and add dry. Kneed for 5 minutes. Cover and let dough rest for 30 minutes

##### Filling
1. Slowly brown onion in pan. Set aside to cool.
2. Mix all ingredients in a large bowl.

##### Formation
1. On a well floured surface, roll out dough as thinly as possible (Don't get ridiculous, but quite thin). Using a glass cut out circles in the dough.
2. Spoon out about a teaspoon of the mixture into little tubes on the dough.
3. Using your finger, wet upper half of the circle. Fold lower half over to meet the top edge. Then slowly pat down the filling and work your way down the sides to securely seal thin edge.
4. Make an indent on the bottom of the dumpling and bring the corners to overlap each other. Press together slightly.
5. Place on a floured baking sheet. When sheet is full, place in the freezer for 30-40 minutes until the dumplings are firm. Then pour the dumplings in a freezer bag. The dumplings are good for a month or two.

##### Cooking
1. Bring large pot of salted water to a hard boil. Cook dumplings for 5-6 minutes. Depending on amount of dumplings, you may have to cook in batches to avoid cooling the water too much.
2. Strain dumplings out of water. Cover with toppings. Mix. Enjoy
