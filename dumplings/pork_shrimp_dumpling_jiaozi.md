Ingredients
===========

##### Dough
* 3 cups All-Purpose Flour
* 1/4 tsp Salt
* 1 cup Boiling Water
* 1/4 cup tepid Water

##### Filling
* 12 oz Ground Pork, high fat content
* 8 oz Shrimp, peeled, deveined, coarsely chopped
* 3 large cloves garlic, minced
* 2 Tbs. Shaoxing (Chinese rice wine) or dry sherry
* 1-1/2 Tbs. grated fresh ginger
* 1 Tbs. soy sauce
* 2 tsp. toasted Asian sesame oil
* 1/2 tsp. granulated sugar
* Freshly ground black pepper
* 2 cups Napa Cabbage, finely chopped
* Kosher Salt
* 3 medium Scallions, finely chopped

Preparation
===========

##### Form the Dough
1. Mix flour, boiling water, and salt in stand mixer until clumpy. Slowly add most of the tepid water, reserving a tbsp or two.
2. Mix for another few minutes until dough comes together.
3. Form into a ball, oil, wrap in plastic and let rest for an hour.

##### Make the Filling
1. In a large bowl, combine the pork, shrimp, garlic, Shaoxing, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, sugar, and 1/4 tsp. pepper. Stir until well mixed. Refrigerate for at least 20 minutes.
2. Mix salt and cabbage and let rest in bowl for 12 minutes to release water. Then wring out in thin towel or cheesecloth.
3. Add cabbage and scallions to meat mixture.

##### Form the Dumplings
1. Form 12 quarter sized balls of dough at a time and place under damp paper towel to keep from drying out.
2. On well floured surface flatten out balls into thick disks. Then roll out with dowel, turning slightly each time.
3. Shape into thin disks which should just overlap all four fingers when laid over them. Make sure edges are especially thin.
4. Using frosting knife place about 2 tbsp in middle of the filling in the middle. Form filling into choad-y shape.
5. Bring together sides of dough and make the first pinch at the center of the curved edge and then pleat toward the center on both sides to create a rounded belly.
6. Repeat until filling and/or dough has run out.

##### Freeze the Dumplings
1. For every ten or so dumplings place on floured plate and place in freezer for minimum of 30 minutes before adding to freezer bag.
2. Dumplings are best if cooked within a month but still good for up to two months.

##### Steaming the Dumplings
1. Boil a few cups of water in a medium pot. Line the bamboo baskets with parchment paper.
2. Each basket should fit about 6 dumplings.
3. Steam the baskets for 12 minutes.

Notes
=====
Serve with Dark vinegar, soy, and sliced ginger.


Dough could still be smoother when cooked.
