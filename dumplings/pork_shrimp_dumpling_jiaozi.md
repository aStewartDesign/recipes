5. Fill with a medium amount the filling. Then wet a finger and trace on the outside of the dough. 
6. Fold the mid points of the dough together and and pleat down the sides forming the dumpling.
6. Repeat until filling and/or dough has run out.

##### Freeze the Dumplings
1. For every ten or so dumplings place on floured plate and place in freezer for minimum of 30 minutes before adding to freezer bag.
2. Dumplings are best if cooked within a month but still good for up to three months.

##### Steaming the Dumplings
1. Boil a few cups of water in a medium pot. Line the bamboo baskets with parchment paper.
2. Each basket should fit about 6-8 dumplings.
3. Steam the baskets for 12 minutes.

##### Pan Fry the Dumplings

2. Add dumplings. Bring heat down to medium. Cook for 2 minutes.
3. Add a few tablespoons of water and cover for 5 minutes.

Notes

Try using a pasta roller down to the second lowest setting. Then a 3.5 inch cookie cutter.
Use corn or potato starch when rolling.
