Terrible for you but oh so good.

Ingredients
===========
##### Rice
* [ ] 2 cups sushi or short grain rice
* [ ] 2.2 cups water, plus extra for rinsing rice
* [ ] 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
* [ ] 1 tablespoons sugar
* [ ] 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* [ ] 1 tablespoon furikake seasoning

##### Tamagoyaki
* [ ] 5 eggs
* [ ] 1 tbsp soy sauce [heaping]
* [ ] 1 tbsp mirin [heaping]
* [ ] 1 tbsp sugar
* [ ] pinch of salt
* [ ] oil to cook

##### Musubi
* [ ] 12 ounces Spam
* [ ] 1/4 cup oyster sauce
* [ ] 1/4 cup soy sauce
* [ ] 1/4 cup sugar
* [ ] Nori roasted seaweed used for sushi, cut into halves or thirds (I cut it into thirds to make it go further)


Preparation
===========
##### Rice
1. Place the rice into a mixing bowl and cover with cool water. Swirl the rice in the water, pour off and repeat 2 to 3 times or until the water is clear. Allow to soak for 20 minutes. Cook rice in rice cooker.
2. Combine the rice vinegar, sugar and salt in a small bowl and heat in the microwave on high for 30 to 45 seconds. Transfer the rice into a large wooden or glass mixing bowl and add the vinegar mixture. Fold thoroughly to combine and coat each grain of rice with the mixture. Allow to cool to room temperature before using to make sushi or sashimi.

##### Tamagoyaki
1. First, beat your eggs well in a bowl using either a fork, or chopsticks if you are an expert chopstick user.
2. Add one tablespoon each of soy sauce, mirin and sugar and a little salt to your mix.
3. Put a small amount of cooking oil in your pan and bring it up to medium heat. Keep some kitchen roll handy to help keep the pan oiled during cooking.
4. Add a small amount of your egg mix into the heated pan. Once the egg has cooked slightly so that the top is still slightly uncooked, push it over to the side of your pan.
5. Add a little more oil to the pan using the kitchen roll and add another small amount of the egg mix to your pan. Again, wait for this to cook a little, but before it sets on top. You can then begin to roll the first bit of egg over the mix you just put in the pan until you have a small roll of egg.
6. Continue adding a small amount of egg while oiling the pan each time in between. As you add more egg and roll it up each time, your egg roll will start getting larger and easier to add new layers. Keep adding the egg in new layers until you have used it all up.
7. Your tamagoyaki is now finished so remove from the pan and wait to cool before slicing it up into thin pieces with a sharp knife.

##### Musubi
1. Slice the SPAM into about 10 slices and put in a Ziplock bag.
2. Mix oyster sauce, soy sauce and sugar until sugar is dissolved and add to the bag with the SPAM. Marinate for about 15 minutes.
3. Drain off marinade and fry SPAM on each side over medium heat until slightly crispy or until desired doneness. Some people like to glaze the SPAM with the marinade/sauce AFTER frying, either way tastes great!
4. Place a strip of nori on a cutting board or clean surface (shiny side down).
5. Place your Musubi mold across the middle of the nori (so if you folded up the sides of the nori, it would wrap around the middle of the can)
6. Add Sushi Rice to the mold, pressing down firmly and evenly, so there is about 1-1 1/2 inches of rice (if the rice starts to stick to the mold too much, dip it in water. You will notice you will have to dip your fingers in water quite a bit because the rice is so sticky. I usually just keep a bowl of water right next to where I am working.)  
7. Next, remove the mold from the rice. Now you will have a nice little block of rice right on the nori.
8. Add some of the cooked spam to the top. Wrap up one side of the nori and stick it to the top of the SPAM, then wrap up the other side. Just like you are wrapping a nice little package. Use a little water on your finger to seal if needed. Serve warm.
9. Some like it dipped in soy sauce, some like it with ketchup, and some like it as is. You will just have to try it all the different ways and decide for yourself which way you like it best.

Notes
=====

You can also serve this, deconstructed as an easy breakfast.

You can bake the eggs at 350 F. for 12-15 minutes in a 2-quart pyrex (7x11")
