Terrible for you but oh so good. Traditionally it doesn't include the tamagoyaki, but I prefer it.

Ingredients
===========
##### Rice
* [ ] 2 scoops sushi or short grain rice
* [ ] Enough water for a rice cooker, plus extra for rinsing rice
* [ ] 2 tablespoons rice vinegar
* [ ] 1 tablespoons sugar
* [ ] 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* [ ] 1 tablespoon furikake seasoning (optional, but encouraged)

##### Musubi
* [ ] 12 ounces Spam
* [ ] 1/4 cup oyster sauce
* [ ] 1/4 cup soy sauce
* [ ] 1/4 cup sugar

##### Tamagoyaki (Optional)
* [ ] 5 eggs
* [ ] 1 tbsp soy sauce [heaping]
* [ ] 1 tbsp mirin [heaping]
* [ ] 1 tbsp sugar
* [ ] pinch of salt
* [ ] oil to cook
* [ ] Nori roasted seaweed used for sushi, cut into thirds.

Preparation
===========
##### Rice
1. Rince the rice until the water is clear. Allow to soak for 20 minutes. Cook rice in rice cooker.
2. Combine the rice vinegar, sugar and salt in a small bowl and heat in the microwave on high for 30 to 45 seconds. Add the vinegar mixture, and furikake to the rice. Fold thoroughly to combine and coat each grain of rice with the mixture. Allow to cool to room temperature before using to make sushi or sashimi.

##### Musubi
1. Slice the SPAM into about 10 slices and put in a Ziplock bag. Rince out the can an keep it.
2. Mix oyster sauce, soy sauce and sugar until sugar is dissolved and add to the bag with the SPAM. Marinate for 15-30 minutes. You can move on to the tamagoyaki while waiting.
3. Drain off marinade and fry SPAM on each side over medium heat until slightly crispy or until desired doneness. Some people like to glaze the SPAM with the marinade/sauce AFTER frying, either way tastes great!

##### Tamagoyaki (Optional)
1. Beat the eggs well in a bowl using either a fork, or chopsticks.
2. Add the soy sauce, mirin and sugar to the eggs.
3. Either bake in a greased pyrex at 350 for 12-15 minutes (easier) or do the following traditional method:
4. Put a small amount of cooking oil in your pan and bring it up to medium heat. Keep some kitchen roll handy to help keep the pan oiled during cooking.
5. Add a small amount of your egg mix into the heated pan. Once the egg has cooked slightly so that the top is still slightly uncooked, push it over to the side of your pan.
6. Add a little more oil to the pan using the kitchen roll and add another small amount of the egg mix to your pan. Again, wait for this to cook a little, but before it sets on top. You can then begin to roll the first bit of egg over the mix you just put in the pan until you have a small roll of egg.
7. Continue adding a small amount of egg while oiling the pan each time in between. As you add more egg and roll it up each time, your egg roll will start getting larger and easier to add new layers. Keep adding the egg in new layers until you have used it all up.
8. Your tamagoyaki is now finished so remove from the pan and wait to cool before slicing it up into the shape of the spam slices with a sharp knife.

##### Assembly
1. Place a sheet of plastic wrap on the counter.
2. Add about 1/3 cup Sushi Rice to the middle of the platic wrap. Press into roughly the shape of the SPAM can. Layer with egg (optional), and spam. 
3. Wrap the plastic wrap around the rice and spam. Then place into the spam can press down on the bottom of the can to form the shape.
4. Unwrap the Musubi and wrap the nori around the outside (shiny side out). 

Notes
=====

You can also serve this, deconstructed as an easy breakfast.

You can bake the eggs at 350 F. for 12-15 minutes in a 2-quart pyrex (7x11")
