Preparation
===========
1. Clean potatoes, and bring to a boil in a pot of salted water. Boil for 20-30 min. Until they fall off a fork.
2. Measure out spices into a small bowl. In a hot pan with a tbsp oil, fry onion and chiles, after about a minute add the garlic and spices, fry for another minute and remove from heat.
3. Drain and peel potatoes while hot if you can. Add to spice mixture and mash together. Add veggies and corn starch. Mash some more.
4. Divide mixture into 8 balls. Press into a rough burger shape. Store in fridge or freezer to firm up. 
5. Make batter with the flour, s&p, egg, and water. Mix together panko and cilantro.
6. Dip each patty into the batter then into the panko. Place on baking rack.

7. Bring oil up to 350. Fry one or two patties at a time, until nicely browned.
8. Serve on a grilled bun with all the fixings.
