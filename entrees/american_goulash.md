One of my childhood Family Recipes.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 2 tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil
* [ ] 1 medium yellow onion, chopped
* [ ] 2 cloves garlic, minced
* [ ] 1/2 lb. ground beef
* [ ] Kosher salt
* [ ] Freshly ground black pepper
* [ ] 1 tbsp. tomato paste
* [ ] 1 1/4 c. low-sodium beef broth
* [ ] 1 (15-oz.) can tomato sauce
* [ ] 1 can san marzano tomatoes
* [ ] 1 tsp. Italian seasoning
* [ ] 1 tsp. paprika
* [ ] 1 1/2 c. elbow macaroni, uncooked

Preparation
===========
1. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add onion and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute more.
2. Add ground beef and cook until no longer pink, about6 minutes. Drain fat and return to pan. Season with salt and pepper.
3. Add tomato paste and stir to coat, then pour in broth, tomato sauce, and hand crushed san marzano tomatoes. Season with Italian seasoning and paprika, and stir in macaroni. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender, about 15 minutes.

Notes
=====

You can swap out the beef for a meat alternative and it tastes just as good.

Add fried leek for a delicious variation.
