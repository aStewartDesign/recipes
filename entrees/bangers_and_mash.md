I never thought bangers and mash were worth trying, but man was I wrong. It's amazing.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 6 cups mashed potatoes

* [ ] 1/2 tbsp oil
* [ ] 8 sausages
* [ ] 1 large onion, finely sliced
* [ ] 2 garlic cloves, minced
* [ ] 3 tbsp flour
* [ ] 1/2 tsp black pepper
* [ ] 2 cups beef broth
* [ ] 1/4 tsp salt


Preparation
===========
1. Fry the sausages on both sides in the oil. Don't worry about fully cooking them. Just brown them nicely.
2. Remove the sausages, then add the onions. Saute until nicely browned. The longer the better, but at least 15 minutes. Add the garlic and saute for another 30 seconds.
3. Add flour and pepper stir over low heat for 2 minutes. Add broth and stir until thick.
4. Add the sausage back to the pot. Stir occasionally for 15 minutes. Add more water if gravy gets too thick.
5. Serve sausages over the mashed potatos with a nice scoop of gravy. Maybe a sides of peas!

Notes
=====

Try to find british style sausages, but any plain pork sausage should do.

Honestly this is a simple meal, I just use instant mashed potatoes. Keep it simple.
