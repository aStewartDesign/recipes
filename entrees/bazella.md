Kind of like a lebanese shepherd's pie, but with rice instead of potatoes. It's really good.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 2 tbsp olive oil
* [ ] 1 lb boneless beef/lamb cubes,
* [ ] 4 cups broth
* [ ] 1 tsp seven spices
* [ ] 1/4 tsp cinnamon powder
* [ ] 1 tsp salt
* [ ] 1/4 black pepper powder
* [ ] 1/4 tsp cumin powder
* [ ] 1 medium onion, diced
* [ ] 1 bay leaf
* [ ] 1/4 cup tomato paste
* [ ] 1 tbsp olive oil
* [ ] 10 garlic cloves, crushed
* [ ] 1/2 bunch cilantro (coriander) finely chopped
* [ ] 3 cups cubed carrots (about 4)
* [ ] 1 lb frozen peas
* [ ] 1/2 bag frozen okra (optional)

Preparation
===========
1. In a large pan on high heat add the olive oil until hot. Add the beef cubes, and cook stirring occasionally until browned. You may need to do this in batches
2. In the instapot on saute, add 2 tbsp olive oil and the onion. Saute for 4 minutes until soft. Add the seven spices, cinnamon powder, salt, black pepper, and cumin powder saute for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and saute for another 2 minutes. Add the beef, broth and stir to combine, then turn pressure cook on high for 45 minutes. Make sure valve is sealed. After cook time is over, let the pressure naturally release for 10 minutes before venting remaining pressure and opening the Instant Pot.
3. While the meat is cooking, prepare the sauteed garlic and coriander. Heat the olive oil in a small skillet on medium high heat, then add the garlic and coriander. Stir and cook until garlic turns golden and coriander wilts (about 5 minutes), then set aside.
4. Saute the carrots in a pan with oil until soft about 7 minutes.
4. Once the meat has cooked through, switch Instant Pot to saute function and add the frozen peas and carrots, and okra. Saute for 10 minutes or until peas and carrots are cooked through and tender. Stir in the sauteed coriander and garlic mixture, and serve with vermicelli rice.
