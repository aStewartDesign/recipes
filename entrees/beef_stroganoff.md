This tender beef stroganoff is pure beauty. This recipe is still being modified by yours truly.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 2 1/2 lb chuck roast, cleaned and diced 1 inch cubes
* [ ] 2 tbsp vegetable oil , divided
* [ ] 2 tbsp flour
* [ ] Salt and pepper
* [ ] 2 1/2 cups beef broth , preferably salt reduced
* [ ] 1/4 cup butter
* [ ] 1 large onion (or 2 small onions), sliced
* [ ] 20 oz mushrooms , sliced (not too thin)
* [ ] 3 tbsp flour
* [ ] 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
* [ ] 2/3 cup sour cream

Preparation
===========
1. Dice up beef and dry with a paper towel. Add flour, salt, and pepper. Toss until well distributed. Heat up dutch oven. Add oil. Working in batches, cook the meat. Allow sides to brown nicely before starting next batch.

2. Once all the meat is cooked, place meat back in pot. Add a bit of the broth to deglaze the pot. Then add the rest of the broth. Bring to a slight simmer. Cover and cook for 90 minutes. Alternatively pressure cook with broth for 45 min and let naturally release pressure.

3. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Salt well.

4. Heat another pan, add butter, add onions and saute for 1 min. Add mushrooms and allow to brown nicely. Add flour. Stir for 3 minutes. Add a bit of the broth from the meat to the pan to deglaze.

5. Add egg noodles to the boiling pot of water.

6. Pour the onion and mushroom mixture into the broth. Stir. The broth will become thick. Add mustard and sour cream. Strain noodles once done. Add to stroganoff.
