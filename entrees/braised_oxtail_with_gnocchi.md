Ingredients
===========

##### Ragu
* [ ] 3 pounds oxtails, cut crosswise into pieces
* [ ] 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* [ ] 2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper
* [ ] 2 tablespoons Diamond Crystal or 1 tablespoon Morton kosher salt, plus more
* [ ] 2 tablespoons olive oil
* [ ] 1 large onion, chopped
* [ ] 4 large carrots, peeled, chopped
* [ ] 4 celery stalks, chopped
* [ ] 1 head of garlic, cloves separated, smashed
* [ ] 4 sprigs rosemary
* [ ] 1 cup red wine
* [ ] 2 cups beef broth
* [ ] 2 15-ounce cans crushed tomatoes
* [ ] ¼ cup red wine vinegar or Sherry vinegar
* [ ] 2 tsp honey

* [ ] Gnocchi
* [ ] Parmesan
* [ ] Parsley

Preparation
===========
##### Ragu
1. Toss oxtails, flour, pepper, 2 Tbsp. or 1 Tbsp. salt in a large bowl until oxtails are evenly coated. Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium-high. Working in batches, cook oxtails in a single layer, turning occasionally, until browned all over, 15–20 minutes. Transfer oxtails to a plate as they’re done.

2. Cook onion, carrots, celery, garlic, and rosemary in same pot, stirring often, until vegetables are browned around edges, 10–15 minutes. Add wine, broth, tomatoes, vinegar, and honey, stirring and scraping up browned bits; bring to a boil. Season with several generous pinches of salt and return oxtails to pot. Pour in water just to cover oxtails; bring to a gentle simmer. Partially cover and cook, reducing heat as needed to keep at a bare simmer, until meat is falling off the bone, 3–3½ hours. Let cool.

3. There may be excess oil. Once cool feel free to spoon off oil.

##### Assembly
1. Cook Gnocchi according to packaging. Optionally, sear the gnocchi in pan after cooking.

2. Add ragu, toss, and top with parm and parsley.
