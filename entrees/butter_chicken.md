Ingredients
===========
##### Chicken Tandoori
* [ ] 1 cup yogurt
* [ ] 1 Tbsp Kashmiri chili powder
* [ ] 1 teaspoon ground coriander
* [ ] 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* [ ] 1 teaspoon ground turmeric
* [ ] 1 teaspoon cayenne
* [ ] 1 Tbsp garam masala
* [ ] 2 Tbsp lemon juice
* [ ] 3 Tbsp ginger garlic paste
* [ ] 1 teaspoon salt
* [ ] 2 lbs boneless/skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1” chunks

##### Sauce
* [ ] 6 tablespoons butter, divided
* [ ] 1 yellow onion, diced
* [ ] 3 tbsp garlic ginger paste
* [ ] 1 Tbsp garam masala
* [ ] 1 tsp chili powder
* [ ] 1 tsp ground cumin
* [ ] 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
* [ ] 1 1/2 cups tomato sauce**** (or one 14 oz can would work)
* [ ] 2 tbsp dried fenugreek leaves
* [ ] 2 cups cream
* [ ] salt & pepper
* [ ] cilantro, for garnish

Preparation
===========
1. Mix all the ingredients to the chicken tandoori in a bowl. Cover and let chill overnight or at least four hours. Skewer at roast at 450 for 25-30 minutes.
2. Melt another 2 Tbsp of butter in the pan over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook until beginning to soften — about three minutes add the garlic ginger paste. Add the garam masala, ginger, chili powder, cumin, and cayenne. Stir to combine, and cook for about 2 minutes before adding the tomato sauce. Add Fenugreek
3. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let cook for five minutes. Blend smooth using an immersion blender.
Add the cream. Bring the mixture back to a simmer, add the browned chicken, and let simmer for 10-15 minutes. Keep the heat low here — not a rolling boil.
4. Stir in the remaining 2 Tbsp of butter, and season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Serve with basmati rice.

try subbing the cream with coconut cream?
