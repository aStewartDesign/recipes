Pretty delicious the first try. Going to have to expand on this.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 1 lb. large shrimp (peeled and deveined)
* [ ] 1 tsp spice mix
* [ ] 2 tbsp Olive oil
* [ ] 6 oz andouille sausage or smoked sausage (thinly sliced)
* [ ] 10 ounces fettuccine pasta
* [ ] ½ yellow onion (thinly sliced)
* [ ] 1 red bell pepper (thinly sliced)
* [ ] 2 tbsp [cajun spice mix](../spice_mix/cajun_spice_mix.md) 
* [ ] 2-3 cloves garlic (chopped)
* [ ] 1 cup crushed tomatoes
* [ ] 1 cup chicken broth sodium free
* [ ] 1 cup heavy cream
* [ ] 2 tbsp corn starch
* [ ] 2/3 cup Grated Parmesan
* [ ] 1 tbsp parsley (chopped)


Preparation
===========
1. In a small bowl mix together all the spices.

2. Toss shrimp with salt, pepper, Cajun seasoning and Oregano, and coat well. Heat a large skillet over medium high heat and drizzle bottom of pan with olive oil.

3. Add shrimp and cook for 2 minutes. Flip shrimp over and cook another minute or two. Then remove to a plate and set aside. Drizzle pan with a little more olive oil, add sausage and brown until nicely caramelized, about 4 - 5 minutes. Remove to plate, set aside.

4. Add pasta to salted boiling water and cook until al dente.

5. Lower heat to medium and add a bit more olive oil to the pan, add the onion, red bell pepper, Cajun seasoning, brown sugar, and a generous pinch of salt. Sauté until onion and pepper have softened a bit, scraping up any browned bits that you can. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.

6. Add crushed tomatoes, chicken broth and heavy cream. In a small bowl mix some water and corn starch. Add half to the pot. Bring to a simmer, stirring and scraping up any brown bits from bottom of pan, simmer a couple minutes. If it needs to be thicker, add more of the starch mix.

7. Once simmering, add Parmesan and stir into sauce. When Parmesan is blended in, add cooked pasta and sausage and stir to combine and heat through, 2 - 3 minutes. Salt and pepper to taste and then lastly, add shrimp.

8. Serve with chopped parsley.
