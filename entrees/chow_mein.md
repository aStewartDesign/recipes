Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 500 g chicken thigh fillets , cut into bite size pieces
* [ ] 3 - 4 cups green cabbage or Chinese cabbage , finely shredded
* [ ] 1 1/2 tbsp neutral oil
* [ ] 2 cloves garlic , finely chopped
* [ ] 2 pkg chow mein noodles
* [ ] 3 carrots, julienned
* [ ] 3 shallot/scallions/green onions , cut into 5cm/2" pieces
* [ ] 1/4 cup / 65 ml water
##### Sauce
* [ ] 2 tsp cornflour / cornstarch
* [ ] 1 1/2 tbsp soy sauce , all purpose or light (Note 4)
* [ ] 1 1/2 tbsp oyster sauce
* [ ] 1 1/2 tbsp Chinese cooking wine (Note 5)
* [ ] 2 tsp sugar
* [ ] 1/2 tsp sesame oil
* [ ] White pepper

Preparation
===========
##### Sauce
1. Mix together cornflour and soy sauce, then mix in remaining ingredients.
2. Marinate Chicken: Pour 2 tbsps of Sauce over the chicken, mix to coat, set aside to marinate for 20 minutes.
3. Noodles: Prepare the noodles according to the packet instructions (my pack says soak in boiled water for 1 minute), then drain.
##### COOKING
1. Heat oil in wok or large fry pan over high heat.
2. Add garlic and stir fry for 10 seconds or until it starts to turn golden - don't let it burn!
3. Add chicken and stir fry until the surface gets a tinge of browning but inside is still raw - about 1 minute.
4. Add the cabbage, carrot, and the white pieces of shallots (i.e. from the base of the stalk). Stir fry for 1 1/2 minutes until the cabbage is mostly wilted.
5. Add the noodles, Sauce and water*. Stir fry for 1 minute, tossing constantly.
6. Add bean sprouts and remaining shallots/scallions. Toss through for 30 seconds or until the bean sprouts just start to wilt.
7. Remove from heat and serve immediately.
