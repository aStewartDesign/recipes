Simple, Savory, and s-quick... I suck at alliterations. Anywayâ€”make this. 

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 10 ounces  Soba Buckwheat Noodles (Do Not Salt Water)
* [ ] 1/3 cup Premium Soy Sauce
* [ ] 2 tablespoons Rice Vinegar
* [ ] 3 tablespoons Toasted Sesame Oil
* [ ] 1/4 teaspoon Freshly Ground White Pepper
* [ ] 1 tablespoon Sugar
* [ ] 1 tablespoon Canola Oil
* [ ] 1/2 cup Green Onions minced
* [ ] 3 tablespoons Toasted Sesame Seeds

Preparation
===========
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the soba noodles for 4-5 minutes or just until tender, stirring occasionally so the noodles don't clump. Drain in a colander and rinse well under cold water, tossing to remove the starch. Drain well.
2. While the noodles are cooking, in a medium bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, sesame oil, rice vinegar, sugar and black pepper. Set aside.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the canola oil and heat until shimmering then add the sesame seed. Cook, stirring, for 15 to 30 seconds or until fragrant.
4. Mix all ingredients in a bowl. Garnish with the remaining seeds and serve warm or at room temperature.

Notes

Can be served warm or cold.
