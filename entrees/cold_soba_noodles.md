Simple, Savory, and s-quick... I suck at alliterations. Anywayâ€”make this. 

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 10 ounces  Soba Buckwheat Noodles (Do Not Salt Water)

* [ ] 2 cups of Dashi Stock
* [ ] 1/2 cup of Soy Sauce
* [ ] 1/2 cup of Mirin
* [ ] 1 tbsp Toasted Sesame Oil

* [ ] 1/2 cup Green Onions minced
* [ ] 3 tbsp Toasted Sesame Seeds

Preparation
===========
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the soba noodles for 4-5 minutes or just until tender, stirring occasionally so the noodles don't clump. Drain in a colander and rinse well under cold water, tossing to remove the starch. Drain well.
2. While the noodles are cooking, in a medium bowl, whisk together the dashi, soy sauce, mirin. Set aside.
4. Mix all ingredients in a bowl. Garnish with the remaining seeds and serve warm or at room temperature.

Notes
=====

1 tsp sugar, 1/4 tsp white pepper, vinegar in sauce?
