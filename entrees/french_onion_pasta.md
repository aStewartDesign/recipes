Found this originally mentioned on tiktok. Didn't use that recipe, but it turned out REALLY good. Tarik demands I make this again soon.

Preparation
===========
1. Melt butter over med-high heat. Add pepper and onions. Saute stirring every minute or so for 30-40 minutes until onions become a nice caramel color. 
2. Remove onions, add mushrooms and a nother pat of butter. Brown. Add onions, white wine to deglaze. Then add thyme, stock, dried pasta and brandy.
3. Bring to a light simmer, cover and cook for 2 minutes less than the time recomended on the box.
4. Add the cream and 2/3 of the cheese. Mix to combined. Mixture should be slightly too liquid. If not add some water or broth.
5. Place in cassarole dish. Sprinkle with toasted bread and cheese. Bake for 15 min at 425.

Notes
=====

This is a mix of metric and imperial mesurements, I'll correct that the next time I make it.
Cheese amount may be wrong.
Baking instructions may also need changing. We want it to cook for a min of 10 more minutes, we also want the cheese to brown slightly.
Try mixing in a dash of sherry vinegar to the final product before topping with bread.
