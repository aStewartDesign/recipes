Preparation
===========

##### Prep the chicken
1. Combine the chicken, ginger, soy sauce, and ground black pepper in a bowl. Mix well with a spoon and let sit for 20 minutes.
2. Add the egg white and ½ cup potato starch. Mix well by hand.

##### Prep sauce
1. In a small bowl mix all sauce ingredients. Set aside.

##### Prep the spicy garlic- and leek-infused oil
1. Heat up a small pan with ¼ cup cooking oil. When the oil is heated, lower the heat to medium and add the garlic and red chile flakes. Stir them with a wooden spoon for a couple of minutes until the garlic and seeds turn light brown and crispy.
2. Strain out the garlic and chile flakes. Return oil to the pan.
3. Over high heat, fry onions and chiles in the spicy garlic oil until onions are lightly brown. Add leeks. Continue to fry until leeks are crispy. Allow to cool and set aside.

##### Fry the chicken

1. Heat up 3 cups of cooking oil in a 12 inch skillet or frying pan for 3-4 minutes over high heat (335-350°F).
2. Fry chicken in batches. Use tongs to split the clumped up chicken. When lighlty browned, remove chicken and set in a paper towel lined bowl.
3. When all the chicken is fried, return pan with veggies to heat. Add the sauce and allow to thicken. Add chicken and coat evenly.

Serve hot with short grain white rice!
