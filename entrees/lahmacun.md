Preparation
===========
##### Making the Dough
1. In a mug mix together the warm water and yeast. In a mixing bowl stir together the salt and flour. After a few minutes you should see bubbling in the mug and smell the yeast.
2. Pour the wet mixture into the flour and kneed for 5-10 minutes.
3. Bring dough into a tight ball, lightly oil and place in a basket to proof for 1 1/2 hours.

##### Making the Filling
1. In food processor blend onions, garlic, tomato, pepper, and parsley until smooth.
2. Pour mixture into large bowl with ground lamb. Add salt, tomato paste and both spices. Mix thoroughly by hand. Add tomato sauce, and mix again into a wet mixture.

##### Baking
1. Pre-heat the oven and pizza stone to 450 F. Punch dough down and form into a log. Cut into 6 equal pieces.
2. On a well floured surface roll each piece into about a 14" circle. Generously flour the flat back of a baking sheet and place dough on it (Use more flour than you think, you really don't want it sticking on the sheet tray). Ladle and evenly spread out about a cup of the meat mixture onto the dough.
3. Carefully jiggle the pizza onto the cooking stone. Bake for about 5 minutes. Until you see some browning on the edges.

Serve hot with toppings.
