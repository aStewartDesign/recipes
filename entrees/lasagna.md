I grew up in an italian american (step-)family. We made the pasta and sauce by hand. It was an entire day event. 

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 1 box lasagna pasta
* [ ] 1 head cauliflower
* [ ] 1/2 onion, diced
* [ ] 3 stalks celery, diced
* [ ] 2 carrots, diced
* [ ] 4 cloves garlic, sliced
* [ ] 1/2 tsp fennel seed, ground
* [ ] 1 tsp oregano
* [ ] 1/2 tsp thyme
* [ ] 1/2 tsp basil
* [ ] 2 28oz cans crushed tomatoes
* [ ] 1 1/2 lb italian sausage, 50/50 spicy/sweet
* [ ] 1 can sliced olives, strained
* [ ] 1 pack frozen spinach, thawed, strained, and squeezed
* [ ] 6 tbsp butter
* [ ] 60 g flour
* [ ] 1 quart whole milk
* [ ] nutmeg
* [ ] olive oil
* [ ] salt
* [ ] pepper

Preparation
===========
1. Preheat oven to 400F. Cut head of cauliflower into individual florettes. Half or quarter the larger florettes. Toss with olive oil, salt, and pepper. Put onto parchment lined baking sheets. Roast for 25-35 minutes until slightly browned. When done, allow to cool.

2. In a medium pot, add olive oil, onion, celery, and carrot. Saute for 5 minutes until softened. Add garlic, fennel, and herbs. Saute for another minute. Add canned tomatoes, bring to simmer. Lower heat to low and simmer for 40 min to an hour uncovered.

3. In a pan brown italian sausage. Deglase pan to get all that goodness, add sausage to large bowl. To the bowl also add olives, and spinach. Coursely chop most to all the cauliflower. Add to bowl. Depending on amount of cauliflower you may not want to use all of it. Adjust to taste.

4. To make the bechamel. In a medium pot melt the butter. Once bubbling, add flour. Mix over medium heat for 3 minutes. Add some milk, and mix until thickened. Repeat until all of the milk is used. Add 1 tsp of salt, and > 1/4 tsp nutmeg.

5. Preheat oven to 350F. In a large casserole dish put some of the tomato sauce along the bottom to prevent sticking. Then layer in the following order: pasta, tomato sauce, meat/veg filling, bechamel. Repeat for 3 more layers. 

6. Cover dish with foil shiny side up. Heat for 25 minutes. Remove foil. Bake for another 25-35 minutes until nicely browned on top.
