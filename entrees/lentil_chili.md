This is an adjustment to an old old recipe from my lifing days. I'd eat turkey chili over a baked sweet potato. Now I'm focused less on protein and more on overall health.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 3 lbs sweet potatoes or yams, peeled and diced
* [ ] 3 tbsp olive oil
* [ ] 1 medium onion, diced
* [ ] 4 stalks celery, diced

* [ ] 1 tsp cumin
* [ ] 1 tsp chile powder
* [ ] 1/2 small cabbage, sliced

Preparation
===========
1. Prehead oven to 400F. Mix sweet potatoes with oil, salt and pepper. Place in single layer in parchement paper lined baking sheet.

3. Add tomatoes, green lentils, and bay leaves to the veggies. Add stock. Bring to a simmer. Turn heat to low and simmer for 40 min or until lentils are tender.
