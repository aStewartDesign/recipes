This is an adjustment to an old old recipe from my lifing days. I'd eat turkey chili over a baked sweet potato. Now I'm focused less on protein and more on overall health.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 3 tbsp olive oil
* [ ] 1 medium onion, diced
* [ ] 4 stalks celery, diced
* [ ] 2 medium carrots, diced
* [ ] 2 fresno chiles, half deseeded and minced
* [ ] 3 cloves garlic, minced
* [ ] 2 tbsp tomato paste
* [ ] 1/2 tbsp oregano
* [ ] 2 tomatoes, seeded and diced
* [ ] 1 cup green lentils
* [ ] 2 bay leaves
* [ ] 3 cups stock

* [ ] 4 lbs sweet potatoes or yams, peeled and chunked
* [ ] 3 tbsp butter
* [ ] 1/2 cup milk

* [ ] 1 lb ground turkey
* [ ] 1 tsp cumin
* [ ] 1 tsp chile powder

Preparation
===========
1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Salt well.
2. In a medium pot heat olive oil. Saute onions, celery, and carrots for 5 minutes. Add chiles, garlic, tomato paste, and oregano. Stir and simmer for another minute.
3. Add tomatoes, green lentils, and bay leaves to the veggies. Add stock. Bring to a simmer. Turn heat to low and simmer for 40 min or until lentils are tender.
4. Add sweet potatoes to boiling water. Boil for 20-30 minutes until tender. Strain.
5. Mash sweet potatoes with butter and milk. Adjust to your taste.
6. In a pan add oil and cook ground turkey. Add cumin and chile powder. Cook until nicely browned. Deglaze pan and add to the lentils.
7. Salt and pepper everything to taste. Serve lentils over sweet potato mash at 2:3 ratio.

Notes
=====

Used pork fat originally to fry veggies. Not sure how much effect it had on the flavor.
