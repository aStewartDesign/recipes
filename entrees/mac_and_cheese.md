If not obvious, this isn't complete. Just ongoing notes for myself.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 1 stick Butter
* [ ] 1/2 heaping cup All-purpose flour

Preparation
===========
1.

Notes
=====

* Roast some veggies and puree them. Add to the sauce to make this healthier.
* Really tasty if you add half a cup of harissa to the sauce.
* Also great if you add a cup of pureed kim chi to the sauce.
