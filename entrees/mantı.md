I admit I didn't understand the love for mantı until I had it properly for the first time. Made well it's easy filling, and comforting.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 1 pkg frozen mantı dumplings
* [ ] 2 cups full fat plain yogurt
* [ ] 2 small cloves garlic
* [ ] 1 tsp salt
* [ ] 3 tbsp olive oil
* [ ] 1 tsp mint
* [ ] 1 tsp aleppo/maraş pepper (optional)

Preparation
===========
1. Bring a lighly salted pot of water to a boil.
2. Combined yogurt, garlic, and salt in a large bowl.
3. Cook the mantı in the water until tender. Taste it to make sure it's soft enough, mine generally needs a few extra mintues.
4. Reserve 1 cup of the starchy water, strain the rest when the mantı is ready.
5. Mix in 1/2 of the reserved water to the yogurt. Add more to get to desired consistency.
6. Heat oil in a small pan. Add mint leaves before it gets hot. Once they start to bubble pull off heat and add pepper flakes.
7. Mix mantı into yogurt sauce. Top with hot spiced oil. Serve.

Notes
=====

* Might be too much yogurt and garlic, start with less.
