Surprisingly filling and delicious. You won't even miss meat. Not authentic

Ingredients
===========

##### Chips
* [ ] 4 whole wheat pitas, cut into wedges
* [ ] EVOO
* [ ] salt

##### Toppings
* [ ] 1 can chickpeas
* [ ] 1 medium tomato, chopped
* [ ] 1 small cucumber, finely chopped
* [ ] 1/4 cup small green onions, finely chopped
* [ ] 1/4 cup flat leaf parsley, finely chopped
* [ ] 1/4 cup kalamata olives, thinly sliced
* [ ] 2 tbsp lemon juice
* [ ] 1 large clove garlic, crushed or minced
* [ ] 1 tbsp EVOO
* [ ] 1/2 tsp salt

##### Sauce
* [ ] 1/3 cup tahini
* [ ] 1/4 cup lemon juice
* [ ] 1/4 cup parsley (could mix in basil, or cilantro)
* [ ] 2 tbsp water, more as needed
* [ ] 1/4 tsp salt

Preparation
===========

1. Oil and salt the pita. Toast on a baking sheet in a 400 degree oven for 10 minutes, flipping half way.

2. Mix all toppings ingredients in a medium bowl and allow to marinate.

3. Blend all sauce ingredients in a food processor until smooth. Add more water if too thick. Should be easily drizzled off the back of a spoon.

4. Assemble and serve like nachos.

Notes
=====

Could also be served _in_ a warm pita, instead of toasted pitas.
