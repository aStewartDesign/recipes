* [ ] 1/4 tsp cardamom powder
* [ ] 3 tbs olive oil
* [ ] 1 tbs vinegar

#### Aromatics:

* [ ] 1 large carrot, quartered
* [ ] 2 celery stalks, halved
* [ ] 4 cardamom pods
* [ ] 2 cinnamon sticks, cracked in half
* [ ] 3 bay leaves

* [ ] 6 cups lamb broth
* [ ] 6 cardamom pods
* [ ] 2 bay leaves
* [ ] Salt to taste

Garnishes:
* [ ] Fried onions
* [ ] Fried almonds
* [ ] Parsley

Preparation
===========
1. Clean the lamb leg, and pat dry. Stab into the meat of the leg many times to increase surface area for marinade.
2. Make the marinade by mixing all of the spices, oil and vinegar. Spread over all sides of the meat. Cover the meat and refridgerate for 1-4 hours. 
3. Heat up dutch oven. Add a splash of oil, and sear the lamb leg on all sides. Add aromatics to the pot, and pour in the broth.
4. Braise in the oven or over the stove for 3-4 hours until the meat is almost falling apart.
5. Caramelize onions in olive oil until golden brown. Wipe pan then toast almonds. Set both aside.
6. Remove lamb, cover, and let rest. Strain the broth. Add washed rice, cardamom and bay to broth. 
7. Bring rice to a boil, turn off heat and rest for 15 minutes.
8. Toss the rice, break up the lamb into large chunks and lay over the rice. 
9. In a small bowl with a few tbsps olive oil, add a hot briquette. This will smoke. Place the bowl snugly in the rice. Cover the pot and let rest for 1 minute. 
10. Uncover, remove bowl, set lamb to the side. 
11. Toss the rice, spread onto a platter. Break up lamb and place over rice. Sprinkle onions and almonds from step 5. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve to starving guests.
