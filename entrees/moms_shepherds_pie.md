Preparation
===========
1. Boil large pot of water and salt. Cook potatoes in boiling water for 15 minutes or until soft. Drain, place in mixer with milk, butter, and parmesan. Mix until Smooth.
2. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 1 minute. Then add carrots, celery, thyme and rosemary. Cook for 3 minutes or until softened and sweet.
3. Turn heat up to high. Add lamb and cook, breaking it up as you go, until browned.
4. Add flour and mix in. Add tomato paste, broth, red wine, bouillon cube, Worcestershire sauce and bay leaves. Stir well.
5. Bring to simmer, then turn down heat so it is simmering rapidly - I have it on medium. Preheat oven to 350. Cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it reduces down to a thick gravy consistency. Stir in peas.
6. Adjust salt and pepper to taste. Transfer Filling to baking dish. Cover with mash potatoes. Sprinkle with cheese and a bit more parm.
