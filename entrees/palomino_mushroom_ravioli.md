Preparation
===========
##### Egg Pasta
1. To Make the Dough: On a large, clean work surface, pour flour in a mound. Make a well in the center about 4 inches wide. Pour whole eggs, egg yolks, and salt into well and, using a fork, beat thoroughly. When combined, gradually incorporate flour into the eggs until a wet, sticky dough has formed.
2. Using a bench knife, scrape excess dough from fork and fingers. Begin to fold additional flour into the dough with the bench knife, turning the dough roughly 45 degrees each time, until dough feels firm and dry, and can form a craggy-looking ball, 2 to 5 minutes.
3. Press the heel of your hand into the ball of dough, pushing forward and down. Rotate the ball 45 degrees and repeat. Continue until dough develops a smooth, elastic texture similar to a firm ball of Play-Doh. If dough feels too wet, add flour in 1 teaspoon increments. If dough feels too dry, add water slowly using a spray bottle.
4. Wrap ball of dough tightly in plastic wrap and rest on countertop for 30 minutes.

##### Mushroom Filling
1. Heat a 1 tbsp of olive oil in a medium-sized pan, once hot add the finely chopped shallots and saute until soft and translucent.
2. Add the chopped mushrooms and cook down until reduced in size and softened. Add the garlic and thyme and a good pinch of salt and pepper, fry for 1-2 minutes. Set aside and let cool for 5 minutes.
3. Add the cooled mushroom mixture to a food processor with parmesan and ricotta. Blitz intil smooth and pate like.

##### Gorganzola Sauce
1. Melt butter in saucepan, add garlic and cook for 30 seconds.
2. Add flour and continue to whisk for 5-15 minutes to get desired browning. Add milk and cream. Bring to boil allowing to thicken.
2. Off the heat, add the Gorgonzola, Parmesan, salt, pepper, and parsley. Whisk rapidly until the cheeses melt and serve warm. If you must reheat, warm the sauce over low heat until melted, then whisk vigorously until the sauce comes together.
