We had a potluck where the theme was hangover food. Thought this would be perfect. Not healthy, but oh so good.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 6 Tbsp unsalted butter
* [ ] 1/4 cup unbleached all purpose flour
* [ ] 1/4 tsp pepper
* [ ] 2 1/2 oz beef broth
* [ ] 1 1/4 oz chicken broth
* [ ] 1/4 tsp msg
* [ ] 1/4 tsp garlic granules
* [ ] 3 Tbsp cornstarch
* [ ] 2 Tbsp water

* [ ] 1 1/2 bags fries
* [ ] 2 cups cheese curds

Preparation
===========
1. Melt butter in a saucepan. Add flour and pepper. Whisk for 5 minutes until a golden brown.
2. Add broth, msg, and garlic. Bring to a simmer stirring often.
3. In a small bowl mix cornstarch and water. Add one tablespoon at a time to the gravy. Stir and give the gravy a minute between adding more slurry for the cornstarch to thicken. You want a decent cling to the back of a spoon.

4. In an airfryer cook half the fries until nicely crispy. Pour into a bowl, add 1/3-1/2 the gravy and cheese curd. Stir for a minute to let the cheese begin to melt. Serve hot.

Notes
=====

Pepper, msg, and garlic are all estimates. It may be better to start with less and adjust to taste.
