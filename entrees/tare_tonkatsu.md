We accidentally had this for our first meal in Tokyo, and were blown away. We had it again that same trip and I looked into why it was so good. Turns out this dish is from a town called Niigata.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 4 scoops koshihikari rice (3 cup)

* [ ] 90 g water
* [ ] 80 g hon-mirin
* [ ] 90 g soy sauce
* [ ] 45 g sugar
* [ ] 4 g dashi

* [ ] 60 g flour
* [ ] 50 g water
* [ ] 1 egg

* [ ] 2 cup panko

* [ ] 800 g pork loin (1.8 lbs)

Preparation
===========
1. Prepare the rice as directed. Specifically rinse and soak the rice.
2. Combined water, mirin, soy, sugar, and dashi in a pot. Heat until just below simmering. Remove from heat.
3. In a bowl mix flour, water and egg into a batter. Set aside to rest. Pour panko onto a plate.
4. Cut pork loin into 6 pieces. Using a mallet or rolling pin, hammer pork between ziplock bag layers. Hammer to about 4 mm thick. Cut each piece in half again, once flattened.
5. Dip each piece in the batter, scrape along the sides until a thin layer stays on. You should be able to see most of the meat. Then cover in panko. Place on a cooling rack to rest.
6. Heat up 3-4 cups of oil in a wok. Once a wooden stick bubbles when dipped, it's ready. Cook 4 pieces of pork at a time. Flip at least once. You're looking for a just past golden color on the breading. Place on clean cooling rack and repeat.
7. To serve: Fill a bowl with rice. Dip each piece of katsu in the tare sauce for a few seconds. Let the excess tare drip onto the rice. Each bowl should have 3-4 pieces. Pour a small ammount of the tare into a bowl to eat along side the Katsu.
