Pretty much exactly what you remember your childhood potato salad at any family reunion to be.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 5 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes
* [ ] 2 cups mayonnaise (your favorite brand)
* [ ] 1 cup refrigerated sweet pickle relish
* [ ] 1/4 cup yellow mustard, or 1 part yellow + 1 part dijon
* [ ] 1 1/2 tablespoon apple cider vinegar
* [ ] 1 tablespoon celery seeds
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon paprika
* [ ] 4-5 hard boiled eggs, peeled and chopped
* [ ] 3 celery stalks,  diced
* [ ] 1/2 cup sweet onion,  diced
* [ ] 1 tablespoon fresh chopped dill
* [ ] Salt and pepper

Preparation
===========
1. Cut the potatoes into quarters and place them in a large stock pot. Fill the pot with cold water until it is 1 inch over the top of the potatoes. Set the pot over high heat and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add 1 tablespoon salt and cook the potatoes for 13-15 minutes, until fork tender.
2. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl mix the mayonnaise, sweet pickle relish including juices, mustard, apple cider vinegar, celery seeds, paprika, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper to taste. Stir until smooth. Then chop the eggs, celery, onions, and dill.
3. Once the potatoes are very tender, drain off all the water. Remove the loose peels and chop the potatoes into 1/2-inch chunks. It's okay if they are soft and crumbly. Place the potatoes in a large bowl. Gently mix in the dressing until it coats the potatoes well. Then stir in the eggs, celery, onions, and dill. Taste, then salt and pepper as needed. Garnish with fresh dill and paprika.
4. Cover the potato salad and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. If you have time to make it ahead, it tastes even better on day two! Keep refrigerated in an airtight container for up to one week.
