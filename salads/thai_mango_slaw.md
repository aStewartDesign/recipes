Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 1 cup wild rice, rinsed

##### SLAW
* [ ] 4 cups thinly sliced red cabbage (about 1 pound), roughly chopped into 2-inch-long strips
* [ ] 2 ripe mangoes, diced
* [ ] 1 red bell pepper, chopped
* [ ] 1/2 cup chopped green onions (about 4)
* [ ] 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro

##### SESAME-LIME DRESSING
* [ ] 1/4 cup lime juice (from about 2 limes)
* [ ] 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
* [ ] 1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil
* [ ] 2 cloves garlic, pressed or minced
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt
* [ ] 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes


Preparation
===========
1. Bring a large pot of water to boil. Add the rinsed rice and continue boiling, reducing the heat as necessary to prevent overflow, until the rice is pleasantly tender but still offers a light resistance to the bite, 40 to 55 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat, drain the rice, and return it to the pot. Cover and let the rice rest for 10 minutes, then uncover and set aside while you assemble the slaw.

2. In a large serving bowl, combine the cabbage, mangoes, bell pepper, green onions, and cilantro. 

3. In a small bowl, combine all of the dressing ingredients and whisk until blended.

4. Add the warm rice to the bowl of slaw ingredients and toss to combine. Drizzle in the dressing and toss again. Season to taste with additional salt, if necessary.

5. Serve immediately, or chill the salad until you're ready to serve. This salad keeps well, chilled, for 3 to 4 days. You might want to wake up the flavors with an extra squeeze of lime juice.
