This stuff is very hot, and a little goes a long way. It goes well with almost all Italian Food.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 6 fresh habanero chillies sliced in half
* [ ] 500 ml neutral oil
* [ ] 1/4 tsp smoked hot paprika

Preparation
===========
1. Add all the ingredients to a medium pan. Heat gently - you do not want the oil to bubble or the chillies to burn - for about an hour. Remove from the heat and allow to cool.
2. Strain out the chillies and most of the paprika (some of it will probably pass through the sieve) and season to taste.
3. Transfer to a cool, sterilized jar (you can run it through a dishwasher or boil it for about 5 minutes). Store in the fridge.

Notes
=====

Avoid touching the seeds or wear gloves if not coordinated with a knife.
Keeps for about 2 weeks in the fridgeâ€”don't eat after that.
