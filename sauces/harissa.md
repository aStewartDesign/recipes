Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 10 to 12 dried red chili peppers
* [ ] 3 cloves garlic (minced)
* [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
* [ ] 2 tbsp olive oil
* [ ] 1 tsp ground coriander
* [ ] 1 tsp ground caraway seeds
* [ ] 1/2 tsp cumin
* [ ] 1 tbsp lemon juice
* [ ] 1 tsp smoked paprika ( optional)

Preparation
===========
1. Bring chilies to a boil in a large pot of water, turn heat off, cover, let sit 1 hour or overnight. Toast spices and grind them.When the chilies are soft and rehydrated, drain and remove seeds and stems ( you can rinse them under running water to get them cleaned up . Place all the ingredients in a food processor and pulse until desired consistency. If you like a “looser” style add more oil.

2. To store, place in sealable jar and drizzle olive oil over top after each use, to preserve. It will last 1-2 months in the fridge.As long as it’s covered with a layer of oil , it should keep well.
