* [ ] 1 cup Extra Virgin Olive Oil
* [ ] 1/2 cup Parmesan or Asiago cheese
* [ ] 1 teaspoon salt
* [ ] 6 large cloves garlic
* [ ] juice of 1-2 lemons (optional)

Preparation
===========
1. Put all ingredients except lemon in a food processor and blend until smooth.
2. Add lemon juice half lemon at a time. Pulse. Taste.

Notes
=====

Initial pesto was a little bitter so I'm reducing the kale slightly.
