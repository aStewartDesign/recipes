Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 1/2 cup olive oil
* [ ] 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped
* [ ] 4 medium garlic cloves, finely chopped
* [ ] 2 medium carrots, finely chopped
* [ ] 2 celery stalks, finely chopped
* [ ] 1 bunch Italian parsley, finely chopped
* [ ] 1 1/2 pounds ground veal (or ground pork)
* [ ] 2 (28-ounce) cans chopped tomatoes
* [ ] 1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste
* [ ] 2 tablespoons unsalted butter (1/4 stick)
* [ ] 1 1/2 tablespoons kosher salt
* [ ] 1 cup whole milk

Preparation
===========
1. Heat oil in a Dutch oven or a large, heavy-bottomed pot with a tightfitting lid over medium heat. When oil shimmers, add onion and garlic, and cook until vegetables are translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Add carrots, celery, and parsley, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes.
2. Add ground veal and stir to break up meat. Once meat starts to color, about 8 to 10 minutes, add tomatoes and stir until well mixed and tomatoes start to simmer, about 5 minutes.
3. Add tomato paste and butter, and stir until evenly mixed and butter is melted. Add salt, and season well with freshly ground black pepper.
4. Add milk and mix until thoroughly incorporated. Reduce the heat to low and bring to a simmer. Cook uncovered until sauce is thick and reduced by a quarter, about 60 minutes
