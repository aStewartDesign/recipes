Toum (pronounced: toom) is an arab condement commonly used with meat, but it's great on roasted veggies as well. It is insanely delicious. Please review the notes at the bottom of this recipe before attempting to make.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 1/2 cup garlic cloves, peeled
* [ ] 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* [ ] 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
* [ ] 1 1/2 cups neutral oil (sunflower, vegetable, canola, etc.)

Preparation
===========
1. Add garlic and salt to the food processor. Blend for about a minute, until the garlic is very finely minced. Be sure to scrape the sides several times. (Optional) Place container in fridge for 5 minutes. Cooler contents have less likelihood of splitting.
2. Slowly add two tbsp of the oil to the running food processor. Allow this to blend together for 10 seconds. Slowly add another two tablespoons of oil. Let blend for another 10 sec after the oil is completely added.
3. Now slowly add oil 1/4 cup at a time. Alternate by adding a tbsp of the lemon juice, and scraping down the sides. Repeat untill all ingredients have been added.
4. Place in contianer in the fridge. Allow to rest for at least an hour, overnight is best. It lasts for up to 2 months in the fridge.

Notes
=====

* This is an emulsion and fairly technical as far as cooking goes. It can split (not form the emulsion) if you don't take it slow. I suggest folks look up videos on youtube if they're unfamiliar.
* A food processor makes this fairly easy, but you can also use an immersion blender or normal blender (look up instructions on youtube for those instructions).
* Check your food processor plunger for a small hole at the bottom. Use this to slowly add the oil. It will all but guarentee that your toum doesn't split.
* If garlic has a green sprout sticking out the top, cut them in half and remove sprout.
* Take your time. Adding the oil slowly is the trick, especially with the first 1/4 cup or so.
