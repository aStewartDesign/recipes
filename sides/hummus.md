Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 250g	dried chickpeas
* [ ] 1 tsp	bicarbonate of soda
* [ ] 270g	light tahini paste
* [ ] 4 tbsp	lemon juice
* [ ] 4	garlic cloves, crushed
* [ ] 100ml	ice cold water
* [ ] salt

Preparation
===========
1. Start a day before by washing the chickpeas well and placing them in a large bowl. Cover them with cold water, at least twice their volume, and leave to soak overnight.

2. The next day, drain the chickpeas. Place a medium saucepan on a high heat and add the drained chickpeas and the bicarbonate of soda. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Add 1.5 litres of fresh water and bring to a boil. Cook, skimming off any foam and any husks that float to the surface. The chickpeas can cook for anywhere between 20 and 40 minutes, depending on the type and freshness, sometimes even longer. Once done, they should be very tender, breaking up easily when pressed between your thumb and finger, almost but not quite mushy.

3. Drain the chickpeas. You should have roughly 600g now. Place the chickpeas and garlic in a food processor bowl. Process until you get a stiff paste; then, with the machine still running, the tahini paste, lemon juice, and 1Â½ teaspoons of salt. Finally, slowly drizzle in the iced water and allow it to mix until you get a very smooth and creamy paste, about 5 minutes. Transfer the hummus into a bowl, cover the surface with cling film and let it rest for at least 30 minutes. If not using straight away, refrigerate until needed. Make sure to take it out of the fridge at least 30 minutes before serving.
