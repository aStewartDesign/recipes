Making hummus is an act of love. Thats the only way to rationalize making something so labor intensive.
It's worth it though.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 250g	dried chickpeas
* [ ] 2 tsp	baking soda
* [ ] 270g	light tahini paste
* [ ] 4 tbsp	lemon juice
* [ ] 4	garlic cloves, crushed
* [ ] 100ml	ice water
* [ ] 1 1/2 tsp salt

Preparation
===========
1. Soak the chickpeas overnight. I prefer to soak for a few days.

2. Drain the chickpeas. Place a medium saucepan on a high heat and add the drained chickpeas and the baking soda. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring constantly. This helps loosen the husks.

3. Add enough water to cover by an inch and bring to a boil. Skim off any foam and any husks that float to the surface. Lower heat to a simmer. After 20 min check the tenderness of chickpea. Cook until tender.

4. Now to get rid of the husks. Stir the chickpeas gently, and pour off the water. This should flush out a lot of the husks. Refill with water, stir, and pour off again. Repeat until you're satisfied. The less husk that remain the smoother the hummus will come out.

5. You should have roughly 600g now. Place the chickpeasm garlic, lemon juice, and salt in a food processor bowl. Blend until you get a stiff paste. 

6. With the machine still running, add the tahini paste. Finally, slowly drizzle ice & water and allow it to mix until you get a very smooth and creamy paste. Taste a small bit and adjust salt, lemon, and water to your preference.

7. Let the hummus rest in the fridge at least 30 minutes before eating. Ideally let it sit overnight. Serve with a drizzle of good olive oil and a pinch of sumac.
