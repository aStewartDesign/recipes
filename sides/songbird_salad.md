3. Vege Prep: Dice the artichokes. Thinly slice the green onions. Clean and Dice the sweet peppers. Mince the Red onion. Quarter Cucumber (long ways), remove seeds, and thinly slice the remaining. Halve the Cherry Tomatoes. Thinly slice the basil.
4. In a large bowl mix together all ingredients except salt and basil. Give it a taste and decide whether to add the sugar. Add basil give one final mix. Cover and chill in refrigerator for a least one hour.

Notes
=====

This recipe is pretty flexible. Adjust amounts of veggies to your desire. Eg. Apples, carrots. I also have a feeling apple cider vinegar would taste pretty great in here if you did half cider, half wine vinegar.
