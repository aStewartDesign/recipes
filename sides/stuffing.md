This is about as close as I've gotten to what everyone imagines as stuffing. Nothing clever, or fancy.

Preparation
===========
1. Put out bread cubes overnight to harden OR put in the oven at 200F for 1 hour to dry out, tossing occasionally.

Notes
=====

You can really go anywhere with this recipe, but Tarik wanted to keep it simple this year.

Add an egg to a few cups of leftovers and cook in a waffle maker. Eat with gravy.

Variations
==========
* Add cranberries and walnuts
* Sausage
* Bacon
* Pineapple
* Try french onion soup style with caramelized onions, beef broth, and gruyere cheese on top.
