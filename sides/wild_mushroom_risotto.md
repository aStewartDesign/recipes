Beautiful dish. Especially with chantrelles and homemade chicken stock.

Ingredients
===========

* 9 1/2 tablespoons butter, divided
* 1 1/2 pounds fresh wild mushrooms (such as cèpe [porcini], hen of the woods, chanterelle, or stemmed shiitake); large mushrooms sliced, small mushrooms halved or quartered
* 7 cups (about) low-salt chicken broth
* 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
* 3/4 cup finely chopped leek (white and pale green parts only)
* 1 1/4 cups arborio rice
* 1/4 cup dry white wine
* 1/2 cup Gruyere, grated
* 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese plus additional for serving (optional)

Preparation
===========
1. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1/4 of mushrooms and sprinkle with salt. Sauté mushrooms until tender and beginning to brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer mushrooms to medium bowl. Working in 3 more batches, repeat with 6 tablespoons butter, remaining mushrooms, and salt and pepper.
2. Bring 7 cups chicken broth to simmer in medium saucepan; keep warm.
3. Melt remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons butter with olive oil in heavy large saucepan over medium-low heat. Add leek, sprinkle with salt, and sauté until tender, 4 to 5 minutes.
4. Add rice and increase heat to medium. Stir until edges of rice begin to look translucent, 3 to 4 minutes.
5. Add white wine and vermouth and stir until liquid is absorbed, about 1 minute.
6. Add 3/4 cup warm chicken broth; stir until almost all broth is absorbed, about 1 minute. Continue adding broth by 3/4 cupfuls, stirring until almost all broth is absorbed before adding more, until rice is halfway cooked, about 10 minutes.
7. Stir in sautéed mushrooms. Continue adding broth by 3/4 cupfuls, stirring until almost all broth is absorbed before adding more, until rice is tender but still firm to bite and risotto is creamy, about 10 minutes.
8. Stir in 1/4 cup grated Gruyere and Parmesan cheese, if using. Transfer risotto to serving bowl. Pass additional Parmesan cheese alongside, if desired.

Notes
=====

I might have also added thyme?
