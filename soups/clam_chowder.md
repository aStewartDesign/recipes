Is there anything better on a rainy, cold day than a thick bowl of clam chowder and some crusty bread?

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 1 pkg bacon, sliced
* [ ] 1 cup celery, finely diced
* [ ] 2 cup leeks, finely sliced
* [ ] 3/4 cup all-purpose flour
* [ ] 5 cups russet potatoes, diced
* [ ] 4 cups chicken broth or stock
* [ ] 1 bottle clam juice
* [ ] 1/2 tsp black pepper
* [ ] 3/4 Tbsp thyme
* [ ] 4 bay leaves
* [ ] 4 cans clams
* [ ] 2 1/2 cups heavy cream

Preparation
===========
1. Over MED-LOW heat, add a small drizzle of olive oil to the bottom of a large dutch oven.  Add bacon pieces and cook until crispy.  Remove with a slotted spoon (or tongs) to a paper towel lined plate, reserving 1/2 drippings in pot.
2. Increase heat to MED and add celery and leeks and saut√© about 3-4 minutes, until soft.  Add flour and stir to coat vegetables.  Cook 1 minute.
3. Add potatoes, chicken broth, clam juice, salt, pepper, thyme, and bay leaves.  Stir well, then bring to a boil, reduce heat and cover, simmering about 20 minutes or so, until potatoes are fork tender.
4. Add cream to chowder, along with the chopped clams, and stir well to combine.
5. Increase heat to MED and cook, stirring often, about 3-5 minutes, or until heated through and thickened to desired consistency.

Notes
=====

Serve with Bread or Oyster crackers.
A vinegarette salad also pares well with this.

Not 100% on the flour yet. But I needed to add a lot of corn starch this last time to get the desired thicc-ness
