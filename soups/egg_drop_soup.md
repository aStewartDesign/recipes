Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 1 egg
* [ ] 1/4 teaspoon salt
* [ ] 2 tablespoons corn flour
* [ ] 1/4 cup cold water
* [ ] 4 cups chicken broth
* [ ] 1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
* [ ] 1/8 teaspoon minced fresh garlic
* [ ] 2 tablespoons chopped green onion
* [ ] 1/4 teaspoon sesame oil
* [ ] 1 pinch white pepper

Preparation
===========
1. Beat the egg and salt together in a bowl until well mixed. In a separate bowl, combine the corn flour with the cold water and stir to dissolve.
2. Bring the chicken broth, ginger, and garlic to a full rolling boil, remove from the heat, and stir in the dissolved tapioca starch. Boil until the soup has thickened and is no longer cloudy, about 1 minute; remove from the heat. Pour the egg into the soup in a thin line, and gently stir the egg in a figure 8 shape, making sure not to overmix the egg too much. Sprinkle the soup with the chopped onions, sesame oil, and white pepper, and serve.
