My husband LOVES Mexican corn, so this might be the best thing I can make for him.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 8 medium ears corn (3 lb. 12 oz.), shucked
* [ ] 4 Tbsp. (2 oz.) unsalted butter
* [ ] 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped (1½ cups)
* [ ] 1 rib celery, finely chopped (½ cup)
* [ ] 1 medium poblano pepper, seeded, stemmed, and finely chopped (½ cup)
* [ ] 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped (1 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp.)
* [ ] 1 tsp. dried Mexican oregano
* [ ] 1 fresh bay leaf
* [ ] 3½ cups whole milk
* [ ] 3 medium yellow potatoes (about 1½ lb.), peeled and cut into ½-inch pieces
* [ ] 1 cup heavy cream
* [ ] Kosher salt
* [ ] 1 Tbsp. ancho chile powder, plus more for topping
* [ ] ¼ cups thinly sliced cilantro
* [ ] ½ cups Mexican crema or sour cream
* [ ] ½ cups crumbled cotija cheese
* [ ] Lime wedges, for serving

Preparation
===========
1. On a medium-hot grill or hot grill pan, char the corn all over, 15–20 minutes. Transfer to a platter and set aside until cool enough to handle.
2. Working over a large bowl, slice the corn kernels off each cob, scraping the cob with the knife to extract the flavorful juices. Halve 5 of the bare corn cobs crosswise, discarding the rest. Set the kernels and cobs aside.
3. In a medium pot over medium heat, melt the butter. When the foam begins to subside, add the onion, celery, poblano, garlic, oregano, and bay leaf. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion softens, 7–8 minutes.
4. Add the reserved corn kernels and cobs, milk, potatoes, and cream. Bring to a boil, cover, and lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are tender, about 25 minutes. Remove and discard the cobs and bay leaf.
5. Transfer 1½ cups of the soup to a blender and purée until smooth. Stir the puréed soup back into the pot of remaining soup to thicken. Season with salt and the ancho chile powder.
6. To serve ladle into wide soup bowls and garnish with the cilantro, crema, cotija, and additional ancho chile powder. Serve with lime wedges.
