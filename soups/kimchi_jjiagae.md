Again, not entirely traditional, but very tasty.

Ingredients
===========

##### Stock
* [ ] 7 large dried anchovies, heads and guts removed.
* [ ] 1/3 cup Korean radish (or daikon radish), sliced thinly
* [ ] 4 x 5 inch kombu
* [ ] 3 green onion roots
* [ ] 4 cups water
* [ ] Salt and MSG

##### Stew
* [ ] 1 pound kimchi, cut into bite size pieces
* [ ] 1/4 cup kimchi brine
* [ ] 1/2 package of firm tofu, cubed
* [ ] 3 green onions
* [ ] 1 medium onion, sliced (1 cup)
* [ ] 1 teaspoon kosher salt
* [ ] 2 tsp sugar
* [ ] 2 tsp gochugaru (Korean hot pepper flakes)
* [ ] 2 tbsp gochujang (hot pepper paste)
* [ ] 1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
* [ ] 4 cups stock
* [ ] 1 bunch of enoki mushrooms, split
* [ ] 2 cups dikon radish, chopped

Preparation
===========
1. Put the anchovies, daikon, green onion roots, and dried kelp in a sauce pan. Add the water and bring to a simmer for 30 minutes. Strain.
2. Place the kimchi and kimchi brine in a shallow pot. Add onion, green onions, salt, sugar, hot pepper flakes, and hot pepper paste. Drizzle sesame oil over top and add the anchovy stock.
3. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes.
4. Add dikon, and simmer for another 10 minutes.
5. Add tofu and mushrooms and simmer for 5 minutes.
6. Serve with a side of rice.

Notes
=====

* It's not entirely necessary to make the stock. Can sub for a quart of chicken broth if you're lazy.
* Instead of anchovies, I used bonito flakes, and leftover shrimp shells.
* You can add pork belly, but I don't think it's needed.
