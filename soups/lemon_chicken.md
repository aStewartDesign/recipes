A friend introduced us to this recipe. Been craving it ever since.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 3 tablespoon olive oil
* [ ] 8 cloves garlic, minced
* [ ] 1 yellow onion, sliced
* [ ] 10 cups chicken broth
* [ ] 2 boneless skinless chicken breasts
* [ ] 2 large lemon, zested
* [ ] 1 large lemon, juiced
* [ ] 1/2 teaspoons crushed red pepper
* [ ] 2 cups pearl couscous
* [ ] 2 ounces crumbled feta
* [ ] 1/3 cup chopped chive
* [ ] Salt and pepper


Preparation
===========
1. Place the olive oil in a large 6-8 quart sauce pot over medium-low heat. Once the oil is hot, saute the onion and minced garlic for 3-4 minutes to soften.
2. Add the chicken broth, raw chicken breasts, lemon zest, and crushed red pepper to the pot. Raise the heat to high, cover, and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium, then simmer for 15 minutes. Using tongs, remove the two chicken breasts from the pot. Use a fork and the tongs to shred the chicken. Set aside.
3. Stir in the couscous, 1 teaspoon salt, and black pepper to taste. Simmer another 10 minutes. Then turn the heat off.
4. Then place chicken back in the pot. Stir in the crumbled feta cheese and chopped chive. Taste and salt and pepper as needed. Serve warm.

Notes
=====

Chicken will probably need to cook longer.
