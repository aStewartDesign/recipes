So we had a similar soup at Art of the Table and tried to recreate it at home.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 4 Pablano Peppers
* [ ] 8 cups Chicken Broth
* [ ] 1 tbsp Chicken Bouillon
* [ ] 1 1/2 cup Masa Harina
* [ ] Mexican Crema for Serving

Preparation
===========
1. Over burner, grill peppers until blackened and soft on all sides. Place in plastic bag for 10-15 min to continue to cook.
Once cool, remove skin, seeds, and core. Chop into course bits.
2. While cooking peppers, heat all but two cups of broth. Add bouillon, salt, and pepper. Cover and bring to a simmer.
3. In a blender puree peppers with one cup of the reserved broth until smooth. Add to simmering broth and mix well.
4. In a small bowl mix second cup of reserved broth with masa into a _smooth_ paste. As smooth as possible to avoid getting lumps in the broth. Add the masa paste to the soup and whisk until smooth. Allow soup to simmer for another 15 minutes.
5. Serve hot in a bowl with mexican crema and chili oil.
