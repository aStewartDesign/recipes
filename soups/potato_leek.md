Served hot or cold, this soup is simple but delicious. Serve with crusty bread.

Ingredients
===========

* [ ] 4 tbsp butter
* [ ] 3-4 lbs leeks, cleaned and sliced
* [ ] 2 lbs potatoes*, peeled and quartered
* [ ] 1 quart chicken broth
* [ ] 1 cup heavy cream
* [ ] salt & pepper
* [ ] chives, minced


Preparation
===========
1. Melt butter in a host pot. Add leeks and pepper. Cook for about 5 minutes until softened.
2. Add potatoes and cook another few mintues. 
3. Add broth, bring to a simmer. Lower the heat and cover for 30 minutes.
4. Using an immersion blender blend the soup until smooth. Optionally strain through a sieve.
5. Add heavy cream. Mix and salt to taste. Garnish with chives.


Notes
=====
Honestly this didn't come out the way I wanted it. First it was too thick so lower the potatoes.

\* I like 2/3 russets and 1/3 yukon gold. This is a hotly dissagreed upon topic. Credit to this blogger who made an [in-depth post](https://botanistinthekitchen.blog/2013/03/07/a-very-close-look-at-potato-leek-soup/) about this in 2013.
